    "\n",
    "dask is a library designed to help facilitate (a) manipulation of very large datasets, and (b) distribution of computation across lots of cores or physical computers. It is very similar to Apache Spark in the functionality it provides, but it is tightly integrated into `numpy` and `pandas`, making it *much* easier to learn than spark for users of those libraries. \n",

    "## What can dask do for me?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of why dask is so nice, let's begin with a demonstration. Suppose I have a pretty big dataset (say, [an 80GB CSV of all drug shipments in the United States from 2006 to 2012](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/)). This data is too large for me to load into ram on my laptop directly, so if I were to work with it on my own, I'd do so by [chunking the data by hand](big_data_strategies.ipynb). But using dask, I can do the following: "

That's why when I typed `collapsed`, what I got back was a dataframe with structure but no data -- dask had figured out roughly what the result of my commands would look like, but hadn't actually computed the result. \n",
    "3. Then, when I ran `collapsed.compute()`, dask came up with a set of assignments it could give to its workers to get me what I wanted and it started to actually compute the table I requested. In particular:\n",
    "    - each worker loaded a chunk of the data, did the observation-level manipulations I wanted, and dropped extra columns. \n",
    "    - then to execute the groupby, it then collapsed the data in each chunk, passed those collapsed chunks to a common worker who then re-collapsed them further, then gathered them again under (potentially) another worker and collapsed further until all the data had been collapsed. \n",
    "    - Finally, after all the data had been collapsed, the data was passed back to me (the client session) as the variable `final`. \n",

    "The answer is that these distributed computing tools are often very fragile and opaque, and it's easy to get in trouble using them, and hard to figure out why if you don't understand the underlying principles that govern their operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This example was carefully chosen. I used only manipulations that dask is really good at, and I have the experience to implement them in a way that works. But do what I did above in slightly different ways, and chaos would ensure. Ok, not chaos. But you're computer would probably crash. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge in using a tool like dask or `spark` (they operate on the same principles -- more on that below) is that to prevent crashes, you have to understand how and why dask is chunking your data. And the best way to do that is to get experience chunking by hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one of the key features of distributing computing is that they don't run code as soon as you type it. Instead, they just keep track of what you want and wait until you run `.compute()` to actually execute your code. Why? Because if dask had run each command as I entered it and passed the result back to me, it would have crashed my computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the whole reason we're using dask is precisely because we knew that loading the whole dataset at once would take up more memory than I have available. It's only because we only loaded a few chunks of the data at a time, thinned out those chunks by dropping variables, and then collapsed by county-state-year that we ended up with a dataset that was small enough that it would fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",

After all, if you could load it all at once, we probably wouldn't be using dask, would we? It's only because dask knows you want to load each chunk then subset it before collecting all those pieces that this code works. \n",

But in the process, it would be throwing away any data it didn't need. Because at the moment it got to `max_shipment.compute()` it doesn't yet know you'll want more analysies on this same data. As a result, when you got down to the *second* compute call (`mean_shipment.compute()`), dask would have to start over and re-load the data all over again. Since loading data is *very* slow, this would be hugely wasteful. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get around this. The first is to combine the two requests into a single compute call so it knows, when it starts running code, that you'll gonna want both `max_shipment` and `mean_shipment`, like this:\n",

This is what is known as \"caching\" a result, and can be accomplished with the command `.persist()`\n",

    "dask is something of a late-comer to the distributed computing game. Before its rise the most popular platforms were Hadoop and Spark (which is kinda Hadoop v2.0). So... how does dask compare to these? Or more specifically, how does dask compare to Spark (since no one uses Hadoop any more) and the Python library for using Spark (PySpark)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of funcationality, dask and Spark basically do the same things. Both are tools for distributed computing across many computers, and conceptually they work in basically the same ways:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Both offer both low-level tools (things like `map`/`filter` in pyspark, and `delayed` in dask) as well as higher-level abstractions (`spark` has `spark dataframes`, dask has `dask arrays`; `spark` has RDDs, dask has `dask arrays`). \n",
    "- Both are fault tolerate (if one machine in your cluster dies, the system knows what the machine that died was doing and can assign it to another cluster). \n",
    "- Both make use of delayed execution / lazy evaluation to allow the system to develop efficient plans for completing a computation efficiently. \n",
    "- Both can be run both on your own computer, or on a cluster of lots of computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The huge difference, though, is that dask lets you write code with the pandas syntax you already know.** Seriously. There are lots of little \"under the hood\" things, but from the perspective of an applied Data Scientist, that's the big one: it's just Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, as we'll see in [later lessons](cloud_dask.ipynb), dask is also insanely easy to setup on a distributed cluster, making it not only easier to use than Spark for a pandas users, but generally also much easier to get up and running. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark, by contrast, is a stand-alone system. It's built to run on Java virtual machines, and Spark itself is written in a language called Scala. It is not a tool for pandas users per se, and so it has its own syntax for manipulating datasets that is distinct from that of `numpy` and `pandas`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for which is more popular, as is so often the case with software, it depends on where you're working. In this class, I've decided to teach dask because you don't have to learn a new syntax, so you can instead just focus on learning how distributed computing works. But if you get a job someday that requires you to work with Spark, don't panic -- you'll find that all the concepts you've learned for using dask also apply to Spark -- you'll just have to learn some new syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "And as for performance, it probably depends on the workload, but I've yet to see anything that suggests dask compute times are slower than Spark compute times. Case studies are always tricky since performance depends on the exact work being done, but here's one [case study comparison of performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13030) that puts dask just a little ahead. And I've heard reports of dask beating Spark by 40x in another project. So personally, I think dask is a no brainer: it will take **much** less of your time setup and use, and it should at least run about even with Spark. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only exceptions are some specific use cases, like network analysis, where Spark has some libraries that dask does not. For more on these types of issues, check out this [conceptual comparison to Spark](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html)."

There's a great new company created by the founders of dask to provide enterprise support for dask [called coiled](https://coiled.io/) (No, I have no affiliation with them, I just think these companies that try to offer paid support services to businesses to help them move from closed source software to open source are a great way to help make open source software better). You can also hear a fun interview with the founders about [both dask and coiled here](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled).\n",

Here's a [conceptual comparison to Spark](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html), and here's a [case study comparison of performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13030). Comparisons will usually depend a lot on the specifics of the work being done, but at least in this case, dask was a little faster than Spark.\n",
    "- Working with GPUs? There's a project to offer the kind of CPU parallelization we get from dask for GPUs called [dask-cudf](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/dask-cudf.html) (part of the [RAPIDS project](https://rapids.ai/index.html). The project is young but growing quickly. My guess, though, is that those libraries will become the infrastructure for updates to tools like `dask-ml` rather than something most applied people need to play with.
