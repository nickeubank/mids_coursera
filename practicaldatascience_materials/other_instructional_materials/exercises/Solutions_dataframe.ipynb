    "**Note:** Most students taking this class are Duke MIDS students who have worked with `pandas` previously. As a result, these exercises are very light on basic pandas Series and DataFrame manipulations. If you are new to `pandas`, I would advise looking into some addition practice opportunities with `pandas`, as discussed on the [Advice for Non-MIDS Students](../not_a_mids_student.ipynb) page, such as DataCamp's \"pandas Fundamentals\" course. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship betwen educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census,\" which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is a 10% sample of the ACS (which itself is a 1% sample of the US population, so we're working with about a 0.1% sample of the United States). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *real* data, meaning that you are being provided the data as it is provided by IPUMS. Documentation for all variables used in this data can be found [here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) (you can either search by variable name to figure out the meaning of a variable in this data, or search for something you want to see if a variable with the right name is in this data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

    "Congratulations! You just discovered \"the sheepskin effect!\": people with degrees tend to earn substantially more than people who have *almost* as much education, but don't have an actual degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "In economics, this is viewed as evidence that the reason employers pay people with high school degrees more than those without degree is *not* that they think those who graduated high school have learned specific, useful skills. If that were the case, we would expect employee earnings to rise with every year of high school, since in each year of high school we learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, this suggests employees pay high school graduates more because they think *the kind of people* who can finish high school are the *kind of people* who are likely to succeed at their jobs. Finishing high school, in other words, isn't about accumulating specific knowledge; it's about showing that you *are the kind of person* who can rise to the challenge of finishing high school, also suggesting you are also the kind of person who can succeed as an employee. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Obviously, this does not tell us whether that is an *accurate* inference, just that that seems to be how employeers think.) \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in the eyes of employers, a high school degree is a *signal* about the kind of person you are, not certification that you've learned a specific set of skills (an idea that earned [Michael Spence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Spence) a Nobel Prize in Economics). "
