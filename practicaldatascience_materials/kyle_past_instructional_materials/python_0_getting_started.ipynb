    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction will guide you in terms of how to get started using the components of this course: the Spyder Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and provide some guidance on how to use Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you'll be programming in Python. Python just takes text files with the .py extension, so you can create them anywhere, but Spyder, as we'll see, is a power tool for making programming easier. Jupyter Notebooks are a different development environment for Python that you'll use for each of the exercises that you complete through this course - while most of the content will be presented through Jupyter Notebooks, you'll do your actualy programming work in Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools all come with the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python. While you can install that for free on your computer, we provide a place for work through a virtual machine(VM), which is just a computer that you can access remotely. We'll walk you through how to launch the VM and subsequently how to launch Spyder in the VM. Lastly, we'll discuss how to use Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Launching the Virtual Machine (VM)\n",
    "Open a browser and go to [https://vcm.duke.edu](https://vcm.duke.edu). Enter your netid and password and complete any multifactor authentication that is requested (if you need help on multifactor authentication, see this [link for assistance](https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/multi-factor-authentication)). You should see this page:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, click \"Reserve a VM\". You'll see a page titled \"New Virtual Machine Reservation\" from the list of  \"Application and Operating System\" select \"Windows Office 2016\" and then the \"Reserve\" button. After you read through and agree to the terms of use by clicking the button on the bottom, you'll see this page:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see the name of your VM listed. In this example, the name of mine is \"vcm-4628.vm.duke.edu\" but yours will be slightly different. Go ahead and click the \"Remote Desktop\" button. This will provide you with a file that has the same name as your VM but with an extension \".rdp\"; you can use to launch your remote desktop software. If you're on a windows machine, you should have a program called \"Remote Desktop Connection\" and if you're on a Mac, you can download [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-8-0/id715768417?mt=12).\n",
    "\n",
    "Double click the remote desktop file (which launches a remote desktop session). You may be prompted for your name and password. If so, enter your netid and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you launch this, you should see the desktop of the VM that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.4.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "It may ask you to perform Windows updates, if so feel free to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Double click on the icon on the left called \"Software Center\" and you'll see a list of software that can be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.5.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll down until you see \"Anaconda 5.2.0 py 3.6 - Install Anaconda 5.2.0 w/ Python 3.6\". Check the box to the left of it and click \"INSTALL SELECTED.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.7.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take some time to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Launching Spyder\n",
    "Once Anaconda is installed, you're ready to begin coding with Python in Spyder. Click the Windows icon in the bottom left corner of the screen, then you should see \"Anaconda3\" as an entry in the menu, click it and you'll see options for a command prompt, Jupyter Notebook, and most relevant here, Spyder. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.9.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Spyder to launch Spyder. When you do, you should see the window below and you're ready to start coding!\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the lessons in this course are presented through Jupyter Notebooks, as you'll see through descriptions later, Jupyter Notebooks combine text, code, and the output of functions all in once place.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Jupyter notebooks can be run on multiple systems (it's installed on the VM, for examples), we've created a place for you to work with Jupyter Notebooks from one simple link. The link [https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers/mids](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers/mids) brings you to a Jupyter Notebook environment you can use (you may need to enter you netid and password):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.11.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see a folder called \"jupyter-r-python-notebooks.\" Click on this, then you'll see notebooks for each of the modules associated with the MIDS Online Review. Go to the Python folder, and this will present you with a list of notebooks for this course (instructions for how to proceed through the course are on Sakai). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the vast majority of the course, you'll be using Spyder - following the content in the Jupyter Notebooks, and trying them yourself in Spyder (this will help you practice and build your coding skills). Jupyter Notebooks also provide an interactive way of working with Python code as well. Before you edit a notebook, make a copy of it first so you don't edit the original content. From the directory with your files, check the box next to the notebook you want to copy, then click the \"duplicate\" button on the top. This will produce a copy. Click on that copy to open the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/0.12.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot you can do with Jupyter Notebooks, so I'll mention a few features here. First off, notebooks are divided up into cells which can contain either text (using what's known as markdown language - it's a way of indicating how you want the text styled) and code (which can be executed right in the notebook). The example below shows a notebook with three cells: one with text, and two with code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/jupyter_overview1.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of features of the notebook. The buttons along the top control things like copying and pasting cells, moving cells around, and executing the code in the cells. These tools operate on selected cells. If your cursor is currently flashing in a cell, that cell is selected. Additionally, if you click on the side of a cell, it turns blue (as shown in the figure above) and you have selected it. You can hold down shift to select a range of cells. You can even make plots in the Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./img/jupyter_overview2.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to return to the folder, you can click the Jupyter Notebook logo in the top left.\n",
    "\n",
    "That should get you started with the core tools for the course. You're ready to get started!"
