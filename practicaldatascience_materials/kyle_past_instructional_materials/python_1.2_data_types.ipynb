    "As a reminder, you're reading this text in a Jupyter notebook, and each of the blocks of code you see below are called cells. In fact, even the parts with text are called cells. When you are in a Jupyter environment, it is possible for you to double click on cells to edit them.  The text in Jupyter cells is written using Markdown syntax, so the text will look a little strange when a cell is in editing mode.  When you are done editing a cell or if you double-click a cell by accident, press the \"Run\" button above to render the text and make it look pretty again.  <mark>**Don't forget that every time I provide a code example here, you should open up your Spyder IDE and type the commands yourself into the IPython console in Spyder to make sure you can produce the same output that you see here.**</mark> If you don't try writing the code yourself, you'll be unlikely to retain the material."

    "\n",
    "There are a few rules around naming variables. You cannot name variables starting with a number, so `1000miles` is not a valid variable name. You can use numbers in variable names, but they just can't begin the name. So `miles1000` is legal syntax. You can use letters, numbers, and underscores, but not other symbols. Therefore, `eat@joes` is not a valid name.\n",

    "Aside from names that simply will not work, there are many others that are less clear to the reader of your code than others. We'll talk more about style later, but generally, you'll want to make these variable names meaningful. Let's say you were trying to represent the speed of a train. You could use a variable `s`, but `s` could mean a lot of things. A better (and more descriptive) name would be `speed`, and better still would be `speed_of_train`. Now, you want this to be within a reasonable length, so `speed_of_train_from_boston_to_new_york_through_new_haven_and_providence` is not an ideal name because it's far too long. Use common sense and above all, make your code readable so someone else could easily pick it up, understand it, and use it."
