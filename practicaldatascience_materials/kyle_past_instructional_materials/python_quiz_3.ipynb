This dataset is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)](https://www.epa.gov/energy/emissions-generation-resource-integrated-database-egrid) containing information about all power plants in the United States, the amount of genereration they produce, what fuel they use, the location of the plant, and many more quantities. We'll be using a subset of those data.\n",

    "\n",

    "**(7)** What is the state where the northern-most power plant in the United States is located?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(8)** What is the ratio of the largest to the smallest number of tons of CO2 equivalent produced by a bituminous coal plant that generates more than the average net generation (in MWh) for bituminous coal plants? *Note: first determine the bituminous coal plants that produce at least the average net generation, then determine the ratio of the largest to smallest number of tons of CO2 equivalent produced.\n",

    "1. The headers are on the second row and you'll want to ignore the first row (they're more detailed descriptions of the headers).\n",
    "- NaN values represent blanks in the data. These will appear regularly in real-world data, so getting experience working with it will be important."
