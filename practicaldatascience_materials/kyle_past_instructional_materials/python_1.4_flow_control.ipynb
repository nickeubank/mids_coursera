    "Using the \"raw material\" of our data types and the operators to do math and compare variables, we're ready to begin using these tools to write useful programs. To do so, we typically control the flow of our programs with conditional statements (`if` statements) and loops (`for` and `while`). Through the readings and this notebook you'll learn how to use condition statement and loops to create more dynamic programs and explore an example of using these techniques to work with data.\n",
