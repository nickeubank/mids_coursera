    "So an important question comes up: when should something just be a few lines of code in a script, and when should it be a defined function? The answer to this question comes from reuse. If you'll need that set of code again (or find yourself copying and pasting it to another part of a script), then it's time for a function. This makes things a lot simpler. Imagine if you have copied and pasted 3 lines of code to 10 different places in scripts that you have written. Then you realize that you need to make a change to one of those lines of code. That would mean making the change 10 times. If, instead, you've written a function that incorporates those 3 lines of code, and have *called* the function 10 times, then all you'd need to do is to change the function itself once to implement the change in all the 10 locations."
