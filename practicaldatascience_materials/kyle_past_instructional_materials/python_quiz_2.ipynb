    "\n",
    "We often want to sort data by some metric. We'll see later that with NumPy and pandas that this becomes much easier to do with other tools, but this exercise will walk you through how to do create your own functions to sort through data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're given a dataset that includes a series of strings that include text from nonsensical words and an associated numerical score value that corresponds to each word. Your goal is to be able to sort the data by the numerical score and find the corresponding word. Your function should take as input three arguments: (1) a key value array (the scores) which provides the order to sort by, (2) the data array (the words), and (3) the rank of the word's score that you'd like. Here, the value `1` corresponds to the maximum score, the value `2` corresponds to the second highest score, etc. *Be careful here since Python's indexing starts at 0.*\n",
