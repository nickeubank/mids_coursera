    "By this point, you may have a number of terms swirling in your head - let's work on clarifying the meaning of a number of these. A **script** is typically an executable piece of code - it can contain all of the things we've discussed so far, including functions, and may or may not return a result. A **module** is typically a library of pieces of code (functions, classes, etc.) and is not generally executable. Both scripts and modules are found in files ending in `.py` and Python can run those files. **Packages** are a collection of modules - typically a folder that contains multiple modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a number of packages and modules in this course. NumPy is a package that contains many numerical computation modules. Matplotlib is a package containing many helpful plotting modules. We'll need an understanding of how these work in order to use them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore this further with a detailed discussion of modules. Let's keep in mind that packages are structured collections of modules that are accessed using similar import methods as discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The following text is modified from [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) from the Python Software Foundation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you were using the Python interpreter, and you quit and then enter it again. The definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a *script*. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a *module*; definitions from a module can be *imported* into other modules or into the *main* module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, go to Spyder. Create a new file in your working directory and call it 'fibo.py'. Open 'fibo.py' in Spyder's text editor (can just double click the file in the file explorer) then copy and paste the code below into 'fibo.py' and save the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: before going forward, try writing your own function to generate a Fibonacci series - this is important practice*"
