    "1. When we go back to read our own code, we can remember what we did quickly.\n",

    "## Tales of woe\n",
    "There was obviously a lot of advice in the articles above, all of which is very good to consider. Here's a list of a number of specific situations that are often encountered in practice (and become problematic for programmers who don't plan ahead):\n",
    "1. I complete an analysis and create some beautiful figures for my big presentation. Two weeks later, I'm given new data, similar to the first dataset, and I'm asked to create some of those beautiful figures. But I hadn't saved the code to create the figures, only the analysis! This costs me 3 hours of valuable time. **If only I had saved the code for each figure I made, I could have easily reproduced the figures...**\n",
    "2. I've been creating an awesome module that implements a state-of-the-art deep learning system. As I've been developing this I've saved each version in a folder called `deep_learning_vX` where `X` increments with each save. I now have 37 versions. I started collaborating with a colleague some versions ago. They start coding from version 33 and add new features, as I continue to make changes. Our changes are conflicting, though and can't merge the code bases together! We also don't know where we diverged... **If only we would have used a version control system like git, we could have easily collaborated and maintained an organized version history...** Version control systems keep track of changes even when made by people working in teams. They are an effective way to collaborate without having dozens of files named something like `myfile_v1.py` and `myfile_v2.py`, etc. The most popular version control system at present is [git](https://git-scm.com/).\n",
    "3. I eagerly code a complex class with lots of methods that rely on one another. I spent a week coding it up, but I'm really excited to test it out. I didn't create any unit tests since that would have slowed me down, and I wrote it all at once as one big program. I go to test it and realize there are a lot of bugs and I have no idea where to start debugging. I pretty much have to throw the code away and start from scratch. **If only I had built the program incrementally and run unit tests on the small pieces, I could have built the code base with confidence...**\n",
    "4. I'm eager to get my analysis done, and I have 35 plots to make. I make the first plot, then copy and paste the code making small changes to each to generate all the plots I need. It looks great! Then I'm asked to make a small change to the plots to adjust the plotting style. This means editing 35 pieces of plotting code. It takes me an hour, but I do it. Then I'm asked to make 3 more changes!! I waste half a day editing plots. **If only I had made a function that made the plots for me that could be easily adjusted rather than repeating myself 35 times...**\n",
    "\n",
    "We could discuss tales of programming woe all day, but the idea is to present some actionable advice to help you to avoid the pitfalls that most programmers make at some point in their careers that are entirely avoidable."

    "## Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two function examples below from [Software Carpentry's Programming with Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/06-func/index.html). What you'll see is that both functions calculate the square root of a collection of numbers, but the function `std_dev()` is far more readable than the function `s()`. Imagine having to debug these functions: doing so for `std_dev()` would be considerably easier than for `s()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example with `s()`, it's not clear what any of the variables are so when we get towards the bottom of the function in the for loop, it's entirely unclear what is happening and why it's happening - what do `d`, `v`, and `m` mean? In the `st_dev()` example on the other hand, it's quite clear that the sum of the square deviations is the sum of the squares of the difference of the values from the sample mean - you can literally read it off the code. That's what you want in your functions - clarity of meaning."
