    "The time has come for us to introduce the workhorse that makes nearly all data science in Python possible: the `numpy` `array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the lists and dictionaries we've already seen, arrays are an object for collecting and organizing lots of individual records -- what's sometimes referred to as a *collection*. Unlike lists and dictionaries, however, which can store nearly anything you want to put into them, arrays are *homogeneously typed*, meaning that each array is designed to store a specific type of data, and can *only* store that type of data. An array of integers, for example, can only store integers, and an array of floating point numbers can only hold floating point numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this may initially seem like it makes arrays inferior to more flexible collections, like lists, there is a major upside: this specialization makes arrays *fast* -- as in orders of magnitude faster -- and it is this speed that makes data science in Python possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as we'll see in future readings, arrays make possible a style of programming called *vectorized programming* that not only tends to be very fast, but also makes the kind of programming we do a lot in data science especially concise and easy-to-read. And if you know any linear algebra, you'll also see that this way of programming results in code that looks more like the math of linear algebra, which many data scientists find really appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays come in many forms, but there are two specific types of arrays whose names will be familiar: when an array organizes its data along a single dimension, we call it a *vector*, and when its data is organized along two dimensions (like how data is laid out in an Excel spreadsheet), we call it a *matrix*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when doing data science, these are actually the only two kinds of arrays you are likely to encounter, and so they will be the focus of the following several readings. However, as we'll see towards the end of this course, there isn't really anything different about working with arrays in three, four, or more dimensions; everything you learn in these first few lessons will generalize easily to all arrays. \n"

    "First, numpy is what's called a *third-party library*, meaning that you don't automatically get it when you install Python. Instead, you have install the numpy library before it can be used. numpy has already been installed in the version of Python you have access to here on coursera, but if you are working with Python on another computer, you'll need to install it using a tool like `pip` or `conda` -- we have a reading on installing third party packages here [we'll need obviously!].\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, because we will be working with numpy a lot, we don't want to have to type out `numpy.` every time we access a numpy function. Instead, it is common practice to give numpy as alias (a different name) by typing: `import numpy as np`. Once we do that, we can access functions from the numpy library with the prefix `np.` instead of `numpy.`:"

In a later lesson we'll talk more about the exact reasons that numpy is so fast, but before we dive in to learning numpy, it's worth taking a moment to illustrate just how impressive numpy is!\n",

    "**Note:** to measure how long each of these operations takes, we will use the `time()` function from the `time` library. When run, `time()` returns the current time measured in the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st, 1970 UTC -- something called \"[Epoch time or UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\" (*Why* is time measured using the number of second since 1970?! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Basically it turns out to be helpful for all computers to measure time against a common benchmark, and 1970 is around the time when the UNIX operating system came online.) So if we record the time before we start running our code, then record the time when the code finishes, then the difference is the amount of time (in seconds) that the code took to run. This isn't the way to do really accurate code timing -- for that you would want to run your code over and over and calculate the average running time -- but it's more than sufficient for our purposes!"

And we're not just trying to sum them up; we are inverting and multiplying full matrices over and over, and running millions of calculations to calculate derivatives and evaluate objective functions. As a result, even with numpy, we are often doing tasks that take minutes, hours, or days.
