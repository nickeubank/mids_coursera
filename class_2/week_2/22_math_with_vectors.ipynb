    "One of the great things about vectors is that we can use them to do math in a very concise manner. For example, if you try and do a math mathematical operation between a vector and either a scalar number or another vector of length one, numpy will just repeat the mathematical operation with each entry in the longer vector. This is a very valuable trick -- since we often use vectors to store a collection of measurements of the same phenomenon (e.g. the salaries of employees, the dollar value of sales, temperature measurements, etc.), it is also the case that we often want to apply the same mathematical function to all of the entries in a vector.  \n"
