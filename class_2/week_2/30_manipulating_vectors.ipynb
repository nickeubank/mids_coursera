    "In our last reading, we learned what vectors are, and how to do operations on entire vectors. But often times we want to work with *subsets* of a vector. Indeed, extracting a subset of elements from a vector is an extremely important task, not least because it generalizes nicely to datasets (which are at the heart of data science). This process --- whether applied to a vector or a dataset --- is often referred to as \"taking a subset\", \"subsetting\", or \"filtering\". If there is one skill you need to master as quickly as possible, it's this.\n",

    "As you've probably already realized, vectors don't just contain a jumble of data -- they also have a concept of \"order\". In particular, vector data is organized along a single dimension (in a line, just as data is organized in a list). So when I create a vector with `42, 47, -1`, I have in mind that 42 is the first entry, 47 is the second, and -1 is the third. And we can use that concept of order to subset vectors by passing the index (order number) of an entry we want to our vector in square brackets. For example, consider the following vector:"
