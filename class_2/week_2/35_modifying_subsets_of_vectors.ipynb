    "The subsetting logic from the previous reading isn't just for extracting subsets of vectors to analyze -- it's also useful for modifying vectors. The idea is that instead of keeping elements that meet a logical condition or occur at a specific index, we can change them. For example, let's consider the vector of the ages we worked with in the last reading. Suppose we mis-entered grandpa's age -- how would we correct that mistake without re-creating the full vector? \n",
