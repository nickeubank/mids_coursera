    "# Working with Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, we'll introduce you to the most basic form of the numpy array: the vector! We'll start by helping to contextualize and explain why we use vectors, then we'll talk about how to create a vector and use it to do mathematical operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors in Context\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in our last reading, the fundamental workhorse of data science in python in the numpy array. While all numpy arrays are similar, they do come in range of flavors depending on the number of dimensions along which they organize the data they contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Add a well formatted image that looks something like the following here, though with numbers clearly in the boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![numpy array example image](images/numpy_array_flavors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of the numpy array is a one-dimensional array, also known as a *vector*. Vectors are a building block of data science because they are often used to represent a collection of different *measurements* or *observations* of the same thing. For example, one may use a vector to hold the heights of everyone in a classroom, or a series of measurements of one's heart rate taken over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we move from one dimension to two, the resulting array is also known as a *matrix*. Matrices (the plural of matrix) are commonly used to represent data in two different ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first, we can create a matrix by placing lots of vectors side by side so that each column becomes a different property being measured, and each row becomes a single entity whose properties are being measured. For example, you could imagine storing data about customers in a matrix, where each row is a different individual customer, and each column is a different type of data being collected (days since customer's last purchase, total dollars customer has spent at store, customer age, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second, our matrix may represent fundamentally two-dimensional data, like a picture. A simple black and white image, for example, can be represented by a matrix where the value in each cell is the darkness of the corresponding pixel, and a color image can be created by combining multiple matrices -- one matrix for the amount of blue in each pixel, one for the amount of red, and one for the amount of green. \n",
    "\n",
    "While vectors and matrices are probably the most used types of arrays in data science, arrays can be extended into as many dimensions as one wants! For example, we could represent that color image we just described not with three matrices, but with one three-dimensional array composed of the three stacked matrices. Or we might also want to work with a three-dimensional array to represent three-dimensional data, like the results of an MRI scan of a brain with MRI signal strength in each cell, or a climate model with temperatures at a given location and altitude in each cell. Indeed, even higher dimensional arrays are commonly used, even if they're harder to visualize -- for example, if we wanted to model how a three-dimensional climate model changes over time, we could think of that as a series of three-dimensional arrays (each representing the world at a given time) stacked along a fourth dimension (time)!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "All the flexibility that makes arrays so powerful can also be **really** overwhelming, so while it's helpful for you to know a little about why arrays are so powerful, we'll start our lesson by just getting a firm grasp on how to work with the simplest form of arrays -- the vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once we feel really comfortable with vectors, we'll talk about how everything you've learned about manipulating vectors can be easily generalized to these higher-dimensional arrays. Because as we'll see, the real magic of arrays isn't that they come in so many flavors -- it's that arrays follow the same logic whether they're simple one-dimensional vectors or 10 dimensional tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are one-dimensional arrays, which means they have two key properties: first, they organize all their data in a line along one dimension (like the lists you saw in your previous readings), and second they are *homogeneously typed*, meaning each vector only holds data of one type (integer, floating point number, etc.)."
