Vectors are arrays that organize their contents along a single dimension, basically the same way data is organized in a `list`. So for example, if I created a vector with the numbers 42, 47, and -1, our vector would store those numbers in order, and I could extract individual elements from my vector by their *index* (their ordering):"

For example, if I tried to create a vector by combining a string vector and a numeric vector, numpy would convert the numeric value to a string so all the data could fit in a string vector:\n"
