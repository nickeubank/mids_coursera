If you are familiar with the mathematical summation notation used in the definition of the Gini Index above, take a moment and see if you can work through how the function you have been given is doing the same thing laid out in the equation. This is an example of this style of programming called *vectorization* in which one works with vectors instead of writing out loops.\n",

In addition, as a result of sampling variation, income binning, differences in the exact methods used to calculate income, year of data, availability of data on top incomes, etc., your Gini for the US will be somewhat different from the Gini for the US in this table. It *should* be close to the data from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219643/gini-coefficient-for-us-individuals-families-and-households/)). How does the US compare to other countries? Is that what you expected? \n",

Results would be very different if we were to calculate, for example, the ratio of the income of the top 0.1% of earners to the income of the lowest-earning 10% of the population, or if we calculated this metric using wealth instead of income!\n",
                "5. Congratulations! You have been hired by the President of the United States to advise them on their efforts to reduce income inequality. The first policy that the president has asked you to evaluate is whether income inequality would be decreased more by giving every household that makes less than $40,000 a check for $5,000 or giving every household that makes less than $30,000 a check for $7,000. Modify the household incomes in our data to reflect these policies and calculate the resulting Gini Indices. Which is more effective?\n",
                "   - **Note:** Vectors are mutable (like lists), so each time you want to modify the vector of incomes, first create a clean copy with the `.copy()` method (e.g. `experiment1 = income_vector.copy()`). \n",
                "6. Now the president would like to know whether income inequality can be reduced more through these transfers or by applying a tax of 5% to households making more than $250,000 and use the money to pay down the National Debt. (In other words, reduce the income of any households earning more than $250,000 by 5%.) Calculate the consequence of such a tax on the Gini Index. Would that policy be more or less effective than transfers to low earners?\n",
                "7. Now suppose we were thinking about applying a 5% tax to people making more than $250,000 and *evenly distributed that tax revenue* to households earning less than $30,000. To estimate the effective such a policy on inequality, first calculate the total amount of money that would be generated by this tax (i.e.the total amount that incomes have been decreased).\n",
                "   - **Note:** because these data are just a *sample* of households in the US, the quantity you calculate isn't the actual revenue such a tax would generate in the real world; if you want to calculate the real amount that would be raised, you can multiply the quantity you calculate by 137 (our data include about 1 out of every 137 households in the US).\n",
                "8. Now calculate the total number of households earning less than $30,000 in these data, and divide the revenue generated by the tax by the number of households earning less than $30,000. \n",
                "   - **Note:** this quantity *is* a good estimate of the amount of money that would be available for each household if we imposed this tax on the real world -- the revenue quantity you calculated in Question 7 was 1/137th the amount of revenue that would have been generated in the real world, but the number of households that earn less than $30,000 in these data are also 1/137th the number of households that earn that amount in the United States, so when we divide the revenue by the number of houses, those 1/137ths cancel out. \n",
                "9. Finally, update the incomes in our data *as if* we had enacted this policy -- reduce the incomes of households earning more than $250,000 by 5% and increase the incomes of households earning less than $30,000 by the quantity you estimated in Question 8. What is the resulting Gini Index?\n",
                "10. Now, suppose that you distributed the revenue generated with this tax evenly to all households earning less than $40,000. Would that have a larger or smaller effect on the Gini Index?\n",
                "11. If the President asked you whether you could better reduce inequality (as measured by the Gini Index) by re-distributing the tax revenue from taxing households earning more than $250,000 even to households earning less than $30,000 or households earning less than $40,000, which would you recommend?\n"
