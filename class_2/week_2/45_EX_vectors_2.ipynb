If you are familiar with the mathematical summation notation used in the definition of the Gini Index above, take a moment and see if you can work through how the function you have been given is doing the same thing laid out in the equation. This is an example of this style of programming called *vectorization* in which one works with vectors instead of writing out loops.\n",

                "2. In a previous reading, we saw that plotting a histogram of US household incomes was difficult because must of the plot was taken up by very high earners. Now that we know how to subset our data, create a histogram of US household incomes that includes only households making less than $500,000. For these households—the non-millionaires—do we see a more uniform distribution of incomes? Or is there still a significant [right-skew / positive-skew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) (most people are on the left of the distribution, but there are more extreme values in the right tail) in the income distribution?\n",

                "5. Go compare your estimate to that of [other countries here.](https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/indicators/SI.POV.GINI/rankings) (Note: in this table, estimated Gini values have been multiplied 100. In addition, as a result of sampling variation, income binning, differences in the exact methods used to calculate income, year of data, availability of data on top incomes, etc., your Gini for the US will be somewhat different from the Gini for the US in this table. It *should* be close to the data from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.statista.com/statistics/219643/gini-coefficient-for-us-individuals-families-and-households/)). How does the US compare to other countries? Is that what you expected? \n",
                "   - **Note:** The Gini Index of income is only one metric of inequality! Results would be very different if we were to calculate, for example, the ratio of the income of the top 0.1% of earners to the income of the lowest-earning 10% of the population, or if we calculated this metric using wealth instead of income!\n",
                "6. Congratulations! You have been hired by the President of the United States to advise them on their efforts to reduce income inequality. The first policy that the president has asked you to evaluate is whether income inequality would be decreased more by giving every household that makes less than 40,000 dollars a check for 5,000 dollars or giving every household that makes less than 30,000 dollars a check for 7,000 dollars. Modify the household incomes in our data to reflect these policies and calculate the resulting Gini Indices. Which is more effective?\n",
                "   - **Note:** Vectors are mutable (like lists), so you should create a clean copy of your income data with the `.copy()` method (e.g. `experiment1 = income_vector.copy()`) before starting to make changes during each exercise. We'll talk a lot more about vector mutability in a future reading, but so long as you use `.copy()` you will be fine here! \n",
                "7. Now the president would like to know whether income inequality can be reduced more through these transfers or by applying a tax of 5% to households making more than 250,000 dollars and use the money to pay down the National Debt. (In other words, reduce the income of any households earning more than 250,000 dollars by 5%.) Calculate the consequence of such a tax on the Gini Index. Would that policy be more or less effective than transfers to low earners?\n",
                "8. Now suppose we were thinking about applying a 5% tax to people making more than 250,000 dollars and *evenly distributed that tax revenue* to households earning less than 30,000 dollars. Call this *Policy Option A*. To estimate the effective such a policy on inequality, first calculate the total amount of money that would be generated by this tax (i.e.the total amount that incomes have been decreased).\n",
                "   - **Note:** because these data are just a *sample* of households in the US, the quantity you calculate isn't the actual revenue such a tax would generate in the real world; if you want to calculate the real amount that would be raised, you can multiply the quantity you calculate by 137 (our data include about 1 out of every 137 households in the US).\n",
                "9. Now calculate the total number of households earning less than 30,000 dollars in these data, and divide the revenue generated by the tax by the number of households earning less than 30,000 dollars. \n",
                "   - **Note:** unlike in Question 8, the quantity you estimate here *is* a good estimate of the amount of money that would be available for each household if we imposed this tax on the real world. Why? Because both the quantity you estimated in Question 8 *and* the number of households you calculate here represent 1/137th the actual, real world quantities in the United States. So when you divide one by the other, you get the true ratio -- the fact that both are 1/137th the real quality cancels out!\n",
                "10. Finally, update the incomes in our data *as if* we had enacted this policy -- reduce the incomes of households earning more than 250,000 dollars by 5% and increase the incomes of households earning less than 30,000 dollars by the quantity you estimated in Question 8. What is the resulting Gini Index of *Policy Option A*?\n",
                "11. Now suppose we also wanted to explore a slightly different intervention: *Policy Option B*. In *Policy Option B*, we would distribute the revenue generated with the same tax, but this time we would distribute it evenly to all households earning less than 40,000 dollars (instead of less than 30,000 dollars). Would *Policy Option B* have a larger or smaller effect on the Gini Index?\n",
                "12. If the President asked you whether you could better reduce inequality (as measured by the Gini Index) by re-distributing the tax revenue from taxing households earning more than 250,000 dollars even to households earning less than 30,000 dollars (*Policy Option A*) or households earning less than 40,000 dollars (*Policy Option B*), which would you recommend?\n"
