    "### Other Uses for Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Not into climate modeling? OK, here are some other uses of arrays with more than 2 dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Images:** In our last reading, we saw that black and white images can be thought of as matrices, as each cell can contain the greyscale value for a given pixel. When working with color images, however, we often work with three-dimensional arrays, where the first two dimensions are the x-y coordinates of each pixel, and the third dimension is used to differentiate between the value for red in a pixel, the value of green in a pixel, the value of blue in a pixel, and the luminance (brightness) of the pixel. \n",
    "- **Repeated measurements over time:** Just as a single survey is easily represented as a matrix, so too can repeated surveys be easily represented by making time a third dimension. This makes it easy to pull out a single wave of the survey, or to pick out all the responses for a given person over time. \n",
    "- **Brain Scans:** fMRI scan the entire volume of the brain, and that volumetric data is most naturally stored in the three-dimensional array, just like the temperature data above. Obviously not all social scientists will end up working with brain scans, but there's certainly a lot of cutting-edge work in this area!\n",
    "- **3D measurements that evolve over time:** just as we can model survey data that evolves over time in three dimensions, we can also model three-dimensional volumetric data that evolves over time (e.g. not just a slice of a climate model, but its evoluation) in a four-dimensional array!\n",
    "- **Satellite Data:** Satellite image data usually comes in the form of sets of 2-dimensional images, where each image includes information about light intensity at a given wavelength. When these images are stacked to, say, generate a color image, or identify wavelength combinations common to certain types of pollution, flood waters, or specific crops, you get a three-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yeah, high dimensional arrays are a SUPER powerful data structure, and one you shouldn't shy away."
